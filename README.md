# Simplex Algorithm

### Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to develop the simplex algorithm from scratch using PyTorch. Beyond being a practical implementation of the algorithm, it serves as a showcase of proficiency in leveraging PyTorch effectively. The project also aims to illustrate how the simplex algorithm can be seamlessly integrated with linear algebra concepts, providing a comprehensive perspective on its utility and versatility in the realm of linear optimization.

### Problem Addressed:
The simplex algorithm tackles problems of linear optimization by finding efficient and optimal solutions for systems of linear equations. It is particularly valuable in contexts where optimal resource allocations are sought under constraints.

**Usage Instructions:**
To utilize the simplex algorithm in your environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrandonRetana/Simplex-Algorithm.git
