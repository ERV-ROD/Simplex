# Simplex Algorithm

### Project Purpose:
This university project aims to develop the simplex algorithm from scratch using PyTorch. Additionally, it seeks to illustrate how the simplex algorithm can be effectively integrated with linear algebra concepts, providing a comprehensive perspective on its utility and versatility in the field of linear optimization.

**Usage Instructions:**
To utilize the simplex algorithm in your environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrandonRetana/Simplex-Algorithm.git
   cd simplex-algorithm
   ```
2. Execute backend
   ```bash
    cd backend
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 Api.py
   ```

3. Execute frontend
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ng serve --open
   ```
